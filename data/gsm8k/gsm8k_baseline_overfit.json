    "question": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "answer": "Calculate the total eggs laid. Subtract the eggs eaten and used. Multiply the remaining eggs by the selling price to find the daily earnings. Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 duck eggs a day. She makes 9 * 2 = $18 every day at the farmer's market. The answer is 18."
